# Cultural Familiarity Annotations
The dataset is associated with the ACL 2025 paper titled ["Towards Geo-Culturally Grounded LLM Generations"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13497) by Piyawat Lertvittayakumjorn, David Kinney, Vinodkumar Prabhakaran, Donald Martin Jr., and Sunipa Dev. 

## Abstract
This dataset was collected during the human evaluation (Section 4) in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.13497). Specifically, it consists of pairs of prompts and AI-generated text for 10 countries (China, Ethiopia, Greece, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States), accompanied by human annotations assessing the cultural familiarity of each generated text on a scale from 0 to 4. The text in this dataset was generated by the Gemini 1.5 Flash model (with different augmentation or grounding methods), while the annotations for each text were done by annotators from the country in the prompt. More details can be found in [the data card](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/cultural_familiarity_annotations/blob/main/data_card.pdf).
